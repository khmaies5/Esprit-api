# Esprit-api
this api is for esprit-tn.com (student space) so Esprit students can use it to access their grade,absences....
it scraps esprit-tn.com and then store the data to no sql database.

i am still working on the documentation it will be available soon.

P.S. mlab database user is not provided with the code you need to create your own.
